SDL3 for C#

Hello everyone I have made SDL3 for C# and you can use Nuget or here to download.

SDL3 from [SDL3](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL)
SDL3_image from [SDL3_image](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image)

But for SDL3 C# has 95 % completed converted by ClangSharpPInvokeGenerator but "SDL_stdinc.h" cannot convert to C# complete because ClangSharpPInvoke stopped to convert whole SDL_stdinc.h to C# format cause it has many errors. We can't resolve but SDL_floot, SDL_fabs etc are not needed just in System.Math and System.MathF

And I would like to release many new tutorial if you know about SDL3 like in C++/C

Enjoy your game development!
